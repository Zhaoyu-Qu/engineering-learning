## Physical layer
The physical layer provides the electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium. It specifies low-level parameters such as the shapes and properties of electrical connectors, the frequencies to transmit on, line coding, voltage levels, and other similar characteristics.

For example, the IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) standards specify the medium (copper or fiber), the connectors (RJ45 for twisted pair; LC/SC for fiber), data rates (10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, etc.), signaling and line coding, impedance and maximum cable length, and voltage levels.

At its core the physical layer carries a stream of bits (more precisely: symbols encoded as electrical/optical/radio signals) and does not interpret the meaning of the information those bits represent.

### Ethernet hub
All data coming into an Ethernet hub travels to all stations connected to the hub.

## Data Link Layer
